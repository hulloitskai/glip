## Usage

Install `glip` like you would any other Go package:

```bash
go get github.com/stevenxie/glip
```

Since a `glip.Board` (a clipboard interface) includes `io.Writer`, `io.Reader`,
`io.WriterTo`, and `io.ReaderFrom`, it can be used just about anywhere:

```go
import (
  "fmt"
  "github.com/stevenxie/glip"
)

func main() {
  // Save "snip snip" into the system clipboard.
  glip.WriteString("snip snip")
  // And we're done!

  // Read clipboard contents into a string (ignoring the error).
  out, _ := glip.ReadString()
  fmt.Println(out)
  // Output: snip snip
}
```

### Advanced Usage:

`glip` provides API-wrapping structs specific to each clipboard-accessing
program; each struct implements the `Board` interface.

If you know which specific program you would like to use, you can create a new
instance of the associated wrapper struct (i.e. `PShellBoard`, `Clip`,
`DarwinBoard`, `Xclip`, or `Xsel`), and set program-specific flags / options
using the wrapper struct.

## Compatibility

### Windows:

`glip` uses the the PowerShell `Get-Clipboard` and `Set-Clipboard` cmdlets to
read and write to the Windows clipboard.

If PowerShell is not available, the `clip` command is used to write to the
Windows clipboard.

### macOS:

`glip` uses `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` commands on macOS.

### Linux:

`glip` requires the _installation of either `xclip` or `xsel`_ to function on
Linux (since there's no built-in clipboard interface). `glip` will choose
whichever program is available, with a preference for `xsel` if both are
avaiklable.

## Known Issues

`glip` sometimes seems to fail arbitrarily on x86 Windows, and I'm not sure why.
It seems like the PowerShell clipboard modules are not very reliable?

If anybody can accurately diagnose the situation on a Windows machine, I'd
be very grateful ðŸ™‚.

## glipboard

For an example of an application that uses `glip`, check out `glipboard`
(located at `/cmd/glipboard/`).

`glipboard` was developed to both showcase how `glip` can be used in a real
application, as well as to be a universal clipboard interface that external
programs can call in order to write to a system clipboard, if the underlying
commands are available.
